1. Created a basic non PnP driver to begin learning windows driver development.
2. With the knowledge from the above driver, made a step ahead and created a HWInterface driver, which reads PCI/PCIe devices configuration space of 256 bytes/4KB to the user application. This data helps lot of BIOS engineers, driver developers and test engineers for their analysis.
